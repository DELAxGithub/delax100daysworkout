# Security Improvements Documentation

## Overview
This document describes the security improvements implemented for API keys and credentials management in the Delax 100 Days Workout app.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. iOS Keychain Integration
- **File**: `KeychainService.swift`
- Implemented secure storage using iOS Keychain API
- All credentials are encrypted at rest using hardware-backed encryption
- Access control set to `kSecAttrAccessibleWhenUnlockedThisDeviceOnly` for maximum security
- Credentials are automatically deleted when app is uninstalled

### 2. Enhanced Credential Validation
- **File**: `EnvironmentConfig.swift`
- Added proper validation for GitHub tokens (ghp_, github_pat_, and legacy formats)
- Added validation for Claude API keys (sk-ant- prefix)
- Implemented secure credential hashing for logging (only shows first/last 4 chars)
- Removed direct environment variable exposure

### 3. Secure Migration Path
- Automatic migration from environment variables to Keychain on first use
- Backward compatibility maintained during transition
- Environment variables are only used as fallback if Keychain is empty

### 4. Security Logging Improvements
- **File**: `GitHubService.swift`
- Removed Bearer token from debug logs
- Sanitized error messages to prevent token leakage
- Added token redaction in error responses

### 5. User Interface for Credential Management
- **File**: `CredentialSettingsView.swift`
- Secure input fields with visibility toggle
- Real-time validation feedback
- Clear security information for users
- Option to clear all credentials

## Security Features

### Data Protection
- Hardware-backed encryption via iOS Keychain
- Credentials never stored in plain text
- Memory protection for sensitive data
- Automatic cleanup on app uninstall

### Access Control
- Credentials only accessible when device is unlocked
- App-specific access (no sharing between apps)
- No cloud sync of credentials
- Device-bound storage

### Validation & Sanitization
- Format validation for all API keys
- Prevention of sample/test values
- Secure error handling without exposing secrets
- Sanitized logging for debugging

## Migration Guide

### For Existing Users
1. On first launch after update, credentials will automatically migrate from environment variables to Keychain
2. No action required for seamless transition
3. Environment variables can be removed after successful migration

### For New Users
1. Navigate to Settings > 認証情報設定
2. Enter GitHub Personal Access Token
3. Optionally enter Claude API Key
4. Credentials are securely saved to iOS Keychain

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers
- Never log credentials in plain text
- Always use `EnvironmentConfig.hashForLogging()` for debugging
- Validate all credential formats before storage
- Use try-catch for all Keychain operations

### For Users
- Use fine-grained personal access tokens with minimal scopes
- Regularly rotate API keys
- Only enter credentials through the official settings interface
- Clear credentials before transferring device ownership

## Compliance
- Follows Apple's iOS Security Guide recommendations
- Implements OWASP Mobile Security best practices
- Compliant with data protection regulations
- No third-party credential storage services used

## Testing Checklist
- [x] Keychain storage works correctly
- [x] Credential validation prevents invalid formats
- [x] Migration from environment variables successful
- [x] No credentials exposed in logs
- [x] UI properly masks sensitive inputs
- [x] Credentials cleared on deletion
- [x] Error handling doesn't leak secrets

## Future Enhancements
- Biometric authentication for credential access
- Credential expiration monitoring
- Secure credential sharing via iCloud Keychain (opt-in)
- Integration with password managers
